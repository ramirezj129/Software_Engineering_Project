# Software_Engineering_Project
### Created a GUI of the University's website as a reference using Qt Editor Team Size: 3
#### Purpose:

  We created this GUI for a class grade in a team of 3 we assembled in multiple meetings before implementation phase and created a use case diagram in our design phase
  next we seperated our work into 3 parts to work on different pages. 
  
  
  The pages were split up into Main screen, Login Screen, and Admin/Staff Screen we created buttons     and matched them appropriately when user clicked on them. We created a .txt file in the system with logins that were authorized so when admin added student to system   if the .txt file contained student name admin was able to add/remove student from being able to login or from class. Staff was able to drop student from class and give grades. Student was able to login see his grade, gpa each login had different functionalities available to themm. Logins were managed by admin username and password.

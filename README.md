# Software_Engineering_Project
### Created a GUI of the University's website as a reference using Qt Editor Team Size: 3
#### Purpose:

  Created a GUI for a class grade in a team of 3 we assembled in multiple meetings before implementation phase and created a use case diagram in our design phase, diagrams and more following the SDLC process, next we seperated our work into 3 branches to work on different sections at a time to minimize workflow. 
  
  The pages were split up into Main screen / Login Screen, and Admin/Staff Screen, Staff/Teacher Screen, we created buttons and matched them appropriately when user clicked on them. We created a .txt file in the system with logins that were authorized so when admin added student to system if the .txt file contained student name/password user was then authenticated, admin was able to add/remove student from being able to login or from assigned classes. Staff was able to drop student from class and give grades. Student was able to login see his grade, gpa each login had different functionalities available to themm. Logins were managed by admin username and password. For full overview of the project view the word document contained within the raw file zip.
